This application was supposed to let the user input an author and/or a book title in order to look up information about the book via 
the Goodreads API. The user would then see a list of books, which should have been clickable and in turn should have displayed a 
description of the book. I think this app could actually have worked, if the app recognized the input stream as a json file. According 
to the instructions on the website, this should have been possible, but unfortunately it didn't. I spent a lot time trying to parse the 
inputstream as xml file, but without any luck. I left the code I have written for the xml in comments, since there's a lot of work in 
there. The code that's not in comments should work for a json inputstream.

I know I'm probably failing this course, however I do hope you will give me feedback since I'm planning on retaking the course next
year. I would also higly appreciate it if you could grade my app as soon as possible. Because if I by some miracle managed to pass the 
course, I need to apply for the programming project that starts next week. Thanks in advanche. And have a nice day.

P.S. Thank you for all the extra time you spend on me. I feel that I've learned a lot because of it, even if it wasn't enough. So thanks!
